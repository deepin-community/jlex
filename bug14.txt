Subject: JLex 1.2.2: Problems with 8bit characters still laying around

I previously had 1.1.1 installed and got strange errors with some HTML
files that I parsed.  After looking at the home page I recognized that
these were problems with 8bit characters (such as german umlauts) and
are supposed to be fixed in 1.2.1.  However, I just installed 1.2.2
and the error is still there.  If I compile the example file and run
it using a simple token printer, I get the following message if
entering a character > 127:

  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 
          at Yylex.yylex(html.lex.java:416)
          at TestLex.main(TestLex.java:6)

The code just around line 416 is the following:

                        if (YYEOF != yy_lookahead) {
                                yy_next_state = yy_nxt[yy_rmap[yy_state]][yy_cmap[yy_lookahead]];
                        }


Thanks for your reply,

        Torsten
