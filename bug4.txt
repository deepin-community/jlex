Subject: Bug of feature?

Hi Elliot, I have just come across what looks to me like small bug with your
otherwise excellent program JavaLex. Macros appear not to be expanded if they
come immediately after a quoted string e.g.

this:

        w="world"
        msg="Hello"X{w}

produces:

       "Hello"X"world"

but this:

        w="world"
        msg="Hello"{w}

produces:

       "Hello"{w}


Hope this helps.

Thanks for your good work,

Nik Shaylor.
