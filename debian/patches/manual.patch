+.SH NAME
+jlex \- lexical analyser generator for Java(tm)
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B jlex
+.I specfile
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+JLex
+takes the language specification in
+.I specfile
+and generates Java(tm) source code for a lexical analyser corresponding
+to the specification.
+.PP
+The lexical analyzer source code is placed in a file whose name
+is the name of the JLex
+specification file, with the string ".java" added to the end.  For
+example, if the JLex specification file is called
+.IR foo.lex ,
+the lexical analyzer
+source code file that JLex produces will be called
+.IR foo.lex.java .)
+.PP
+The resulting lexical analyzer source code
+should be compiled with a Java compiler.
+This produces a lexical analyzer class file,
+which can then be used in your application.
+If the default settings have not been changed,
+the lexical analyzer class will be called Yylex
+and the class files will named Yylex.class and Yytoken.class.
+.PP
