Dear Elliot,

congratulations for writing such a tool as JavaLex!
I downloaded and tried it today and it works great.

However, did you ever try to input a character >127 to the 
generated program?
When I do this (by typing a german umlaut for example), I get an 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Any idea? As far as I could see you store the input in byte 
arrays which would lead to negative bytes for 
beyound-ASCII-characters. I could imagine you use the byte 
values as an index somewhere ...
Unfortunately I couldn't debug it yet, but will do tomorrow.
 
BTW, yes, I have the %full directive in my source file ...
