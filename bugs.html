<strong>Please check your JVM before mailing in a bug report!</strong>
There have been a spate of recent reports which have been traced down
to buggy virtual machines (e.g. <code>kaffe</code>) or compilers 
(e.g. <code>pizza</code>).  Please take a second to check that your bug
can be reproduced using "standard" tools before reporting a bug.
